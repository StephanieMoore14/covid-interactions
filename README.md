Networking with people is essential to meeting and expanding your connections, but due to the pandemic in 2020 the number of people you may be meeting has decreased.  For this riddle hack, we created a short questionnaire to determine how many people you will meet pre and post COVID-19.  Based on your answers in the questionaire, you can see how many people you will meet this year!
